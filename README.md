How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

User needs are the requirements that a client or customer would like to have for their system/software and i implement them by creating code to address exactly what the customer is asking and being sure to ask for constant feedback. User stories help by having a way to tell developers what to do and what they want the software to accomplish, its a great way to bridge the gap between software engineers and the users of the intended system. 

How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

I approach developing programs first by making sure I understand the requirements and following all scrum-agile principles and guidelines. I have already started incorporating various agile process to my current job and I am finding that i am more efficient by constantly asking for feedback and adapting appropiately. 

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
